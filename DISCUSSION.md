The idea behind this project is to create an extendible conlang/auxlang built by committee; See: http://ayadan.moosader.com/2015/10/20/creating-an-inclusive-auxlang/

Starting out, we have a few contributors, but the language needs to be created in a way that is open
for extending by anyone who feels like their perceptions are not covered properly.

Another thought is that, since this is somewhat of an auxlang project, we should follow in
toki pona's steps and make the sounds of the language easy for anyone from any background to use.
Additionally, Becca suggested that the phonemes be built in such a way that allows for easier
lip-reading by a person who is deaf.

But the project is starting small, with only two to four people to start with.
I guess the first order of business is to come up with the sounds of the language.
